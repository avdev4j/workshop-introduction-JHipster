# Generate our first JHipster application
First, we need to choose a root folder where we will create all our projects.
To simplify I will use `/tmp` as the root folder. You can choose any other one you want, it does not matter
but be careful to update the command lines with the right value.

### Create our application folder
Open a terminal, go into the `/tmp` folder and create an application folder named Open a terminal, go into the `/tmp` 
folder and create an application folder named `jhiWorkshop`.

```
cd /tmp
mkdir jhiWorkshop && cd jhiWorkshop
 ```
 
 ### Generate the project
 Once in your project folder, launch JHipster. Fill the questions with the responses below.
 You can also add the [.yo-rc.json](https://github.com/avdev4j/workshop-introduction-JHipster/blob/master/resources/.yo-rc.json) 
 provided and launch the JHipster CLI. All the configuration will be loaded from it.
 
 ```
jhipster
 ```
 
 ```

 ### Going deep in the generated files
 If you used to use JHipster you will not be surprised by the following generated code. Otherwise 
 I suggest you to take time to understand the architecture.
 Anyway the code is near from a classic Spring Boot/React project.


#### Run the application
In your terminal, write
``` 
./mvnw
```

This will launch both frontend and backend application that will be reachable at the following URL [http://localhost:8080](http://localhost:8080).

When the following message appear in your teminal, the application is ready !

```

----------------------------------------------------------
	Application 'jhiWorkshop' is running! Access URLs:
	Local: 		http://localhost:8080/
	External: 	http://10.92.16.43:8080/
	Profile(s): 	[dev, swagger]
----------------------------------------------------------

```

#### Going further
JHipster allow you to use advanced settings by using [options](https://www.jhipster.tech/creating-an-app/#3) with the JHipster command.

Example:
For generate a front only application you can use the following command
`jhipster --skip-server --auth jwt --db postgresql`

For this option we need to add two other options `auth` and `db` usually filled by the server generator prompt.
