# Define a JDL
The JDL is a JHipster-specific domain language where you can describe all your applications, 
deployments, entities and their relationships in a single file (or more than one) with a user-friendly syntax.

To define you JDL you can use both JDL-studio or the JHipster IDE plugin (VSCode/Eclipse/Atom).

It's up to you but for this workshop I will use the [JDL-studio](https://start.jhipster.tech/jdl-studio/).

## What JDL can do for me?
* Define a full JHipster application with options (frameworks, cache, db...).
* Define my entities and the relationships
* Add validation rules on fields (length, mandatory)

## What should I do with my JDL ?
The JDL can be export to a .jh file and added to your project.
Then the import-jdl command allow you to import all your entities and create all files from entity layer to frontend forms.

`jhipster import-jdl myjdl.jh`

## Going further
All documentation you need can be found on the official [JHipster website](https://www.jhipster.tech/jdl/)

## Example

![Default JHipster JDL](https://github.com/avdev4j/workshop-introduction-JHipster/blob/master/resources/jdl.png)

``` 
entity Region {
	regionName String
    toto String
}

entity Country {
	countryName String
}

// an ignored comment
/** not an ignored comment */
entity Location {
	streetAddress String,
	postalCode String,
	city String,
	stateProvince String
}

entity Department {
	departmentName String required
}

/**
 * Task entity.
 * @author The JHipster team.
 */
entity Task {
	title String,
	description String
}

/**
 * The Employee entity.
 */
entity Employee {
	/**
	* The firstname attribute.
	*/
	firstName String,
	lastName String,
	email String,
	phoneNumber String,
	hireDate Instant,
	salary Long,
	commissionPct Long
}

entity Job {
	jobTitle String,
	minSalary Long,
	maxSalary Long
}

entity JobHistory {
	startDate Instant,
	endDate Instant,
	language Language
}

enum Language {
    FRENCH, ENGLISH, SPANISH
}

relationship OneToOne {
	Country{region} to Region
}

relationship OneToOne {
	Location{country} to Country
}

relationship OneToOne {
	Department{location} to Location
}

relationship ManyToMany {
	Job{task(title)} to Task{job}
}

// defining multiple OneToMany relationships with comments
relationship OneToMany {
	Employee{job} to Job,
	/**
	* A relationship
	*/
	Department{employee} to
	/**
	* Another side of the same relationship
	*/
	Employee
}

relationship ManyToOne {
	Employee{manager} to Employee
}

// defining multiple oneToOne relationships
relationship OneToOne {
	JobHistory{job} to Job,
	JobHistory{department} to Department,
	JobHistory{employee} to Employee
}

// Set pagination options
paginate JobHistory, Employee with infinite-scroll
paginate Job with pagination

// Use Data Transfert Objects (DTO)
// dto * with mapstruct

// Set service options to all except few
service all with serviceImpl except Employee, Job

```
